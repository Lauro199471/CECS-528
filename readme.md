# CECS 528 : Analysis of Algorithms

## Course Description
In this course we study some of the most important and exemplary algorithms from computer science. Moreover, we primarily focus on the three major algorithm families: greedy, dvide-and-conquer, and dynamic programming. We also explore approximation algorithms, linear programming, and the algorithmic technique of reducibility.

In addition to a broad exposure to algorithms, we also study the mathematical techniques needed to analyze an algorithm. The three most common aspects of an algorithm that require analysis include its correctness, running time, and an efficient implementation for achieving the running time. Analyzing correctness means proving that an algorithm returns the correct output for any given input. For an approximation alroithm we want to prove the degree to which the algorithm approximates the actual problem solution. In addition to being correct, we desire to prove tight upper and lower bounds on the time or space required for an algorithm to return its output. Moreover, when proving such bounds, one must often provide the data structures that are needed to support the desired time and space bounds. We finish the course with an introduction to computational complexity theory, whose goal is to determine the intrinsic time and space complexity of any given problem. We use this theory to establish problems that are candidates for being the "hardest that can be efficiently solved", as well as candidates that likely cannot be efficiently solved.
